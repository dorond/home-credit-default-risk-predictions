Home Credit Default Risk Predictions
==============================

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

This project contains my solution to the problem.

The folder structure below is derived from the <a target="_blank" href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">cookiecutter data science project template</a>, with some modifications.

The `notebooks` folder contains all the exploratory and preliminary work that was used to understand the data, determine preprocessing steps and experiment with models. 

Source code that was refactored from this process ends up in the `src` folder and along with a project MAKEFILE, the entire data preperation, analysis and modelling project can be rebuilt from scratch.
